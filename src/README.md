Project 1: Tokenizer
====================

# How to run:
1. Open shell and compile using 'make'
   * (Run 'make clean' if needed)
   * .o files should be created at this point
1. Once on shell write ./tokenizer
   * Then it will proceed to ask you for a string

# Definitions:
 *  *uimain.c*
    * This is UI, which contains the main method.
 *  *tokenizer.c*
    * This is where all the functions are located
 *  *history.c*
    * This file contains the functions for the history operations

# Important note
  * Most of the functions have a description located next to them
  * I couldn't make the tester file work, I used [OnlineGDB]
  (https://www.onlinegdb.com) to test my code while I was working
